- cannot access /var/opt/oracle/managed/exapatch/mcpostpatch: where is it?
- purge home: sometimes issues in OCI console
- should working copies of home not show up in the console...? how else do we add DBs?

clean-up issues
- image_name and wc_name: naming conventions vs. when to specify? esp if wc_name utilizes image_name
- should there be standalone query image, query wc?
- image_type in multiple different situations: should have different names when different values expected
- ru_version needs another 0 for map?
- figure out host vs. group for jumping between environments
