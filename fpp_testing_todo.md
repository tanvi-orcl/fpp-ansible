- naming conventions!!
- follow up on communication issue with OCI console (purge home / missing working copies)
- map: see if ru_version needs another 0 / if name can have 6 instead of 5 letters
- figure out host vs. group for design/repeating tasks + jumping between environments
- for working copy, when creating a new home, should we be doing cswlib? does the name change when a new version comes out? If not automatically doing a cswlib, should probably still do a check to make sure version is there and then run cswlib if not.

clean-up
- check if variables are defined
- debug messages
- setting vars vs. passing vars
- task names
